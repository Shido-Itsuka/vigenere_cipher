key: 0XXXX-0YYYY-ZZZZZ-12345

0:
    A = +x, +y
    B = -x, +y
    C = +x, -y
    D = -x, -y

XXXX -> (x, y) of 1st "y = f(x)"
    XX = (x..) and XX (..y)

YYYY -> (x, y) of 2nd "y = f(x)"
    bla bla bla

ZZZZZ -> type of key + salt
    P.S. 1st type is "unlimited" - unlocks all in program
    2nd type is ... <in the process of inventing>

12345 -> random sequence of numbers which can be decode
